Support Haskell Code for Lambda Calculus Interpretor

This project contains support material that I created while serving as a TA for Programming Languages
(CSCI.4430/6430) Fall 2015 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This project does NOT contain the solution
to the lambda calculus interpreter problem; only materials that were publicly available to students and 
were created by me.
